# mushroom_classification
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525).  Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.
